https://www.glencore.com/media-and-insights/news/kazzinc-environmental-incident","On 22 May 2016, inert tailing slurry was discharged via a previously discontinued and sealed water discharge collector system into the Filippovka River from Talovsky Tailings Management Facility (TMF). The discharge occurred due to the failure of a water collector that, prior to 1979, was used to regulate the amount of water on the surface of the tailings dam. Talovsky TMF is part of the Ridder Ore Concentrator at our Kazzinc operation in the town of Ridder, Kazakhstan. Pollution spilled into the Ulba and Filippovka rivers, which flows near the Kazakhstan-Russian border, and headed toward the Siberian city of Omsk. Pictures of the polluted river look like freshwater was replaced by wet concrete. Reports from local partners say the waste contained cyanide and excess minerals such as zinc, lead copper and manganese, though mining and government officials downplayed the severity of the spill and presence of toxins. The ore from Tishinsky, Shubinsky and Ridder-Sokolny mines and gold-bearing tailings accumulated in the abandoned TSF are treated at the Ridder Concentrator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
